In my research I have found that there are three AI applications that have similar ideas as them they are known as Kira Systems, LawGeex, and Evisort. The first two Kira Systems and LawGeex are contract readers while similar to our idea these programs are made for companies to own and license while we want to design our program for individuals and small businesses with pricing for these two going from 600-4,000 dollars per month which isnâ€™t sustainable for people and is missing a key component we would like which is suggesting changes to the contract before signing it to keep it fair for you the signer. This is where Evisort comes in this program is designed solely to suggest negotiation changes to the contract you are currently looking at which again while similar runs into the issue of costing too much for the user base we are looking for with it being annually 15,000.
